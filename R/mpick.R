#' Subsetting by picking random levels from multiple factors
#' 
#' Like \code{\link{pick}}, but allows specifying multiple factors (columns) at the same time, trying hard to return the desired result. You want 2 species from the same 3 strata during the same 4 years? Use \code{mpick}. Want just one of those? Use \code{pick}.
#' 
#' @param X A data.table  
#' @param p A named vector of integers. Names are columns in \code{X}, the integers are the number of levels to select  
#' @param weight Logical, default FALSE. Same as \code{w} in \code{\link{pick}}; weight selection of factor level by its relevative frequency of occurrence in \code{X}. Could have performance implications, see 'Details'.  
#' @param limit Time limit for searching, in seconds  
#' @param screen Logical If TRUE (default) then before random searching, will screen out factor levels that definitely cannot satisfy the full sweet of conditions in \code{p}. Can be a little slow, but is extremely effect when most combinations of factors in \code{p} do not exist. See 'Details'.  
#' @param dt Logical, if TRUE, returns a data.table; if FALSE (default), returns an index of that data.table?  
#' 
#' @seealso \code{\link{pick}}
#' 
#' @details
#' This problem may ultimately be better suited for a real optimization algorithm. Right now, relies and arbitrary guess-and-check. Does not "forget" failed guesses (only specific combinations are worth forgetting, and for large data sets there's a very low probability of happening upon same combination). Thus, this is a very brute-force approach, with the exception of the checking done when \code{screen=TRUE}.
#' 
#' It is highly recommended that \code{limit} be set to allow for a couple minutes of searching. Of course, this depends on the size of \code{X} and the details of \code{p}.
#' 
#' \code{screen} is very effective when many possible factor levels in \code{p} can be ruled out based on their overall scarcity. Consider the example of 2 spp, 3 stratum, 4 year. If a given level of spp does not occur at least 3*4=12 times in the data set, it can be ruled out. Because very rare species comprise the majority of unique spp in trawl data, this screening can be outstandingly effective.
#' 
#' Be aware that it is easy to accidentally ask a lot of this function, and don't be surprised when it doesn't give you an answer quickly, or at all. For example, asking for 10 spp 5 stratum 5 year might seem meager for a data set observed over 30 years for 100 strata and 800 spp. However, this is a big ask: 10 species found together in the same 5 places in each of 5 years. If the average stratum has about 30 species, you're requesting that a 3rd of the local biodiversity constitute the same species 25 separate times. If a stratum is small or if species are cosmopolitan, you might get a good result; but that'd be lucky.

#' @section Warning:
#' This function is still experimental. See \url{http://stackoverflow.com/q/33714985/2343633} for possible updates (but this was not a popular question).
